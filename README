Welcome to the Maths Codex, a work in progress.

Synopsis

The purpose of this application is (eventually) to aid in the development
of rigorous mathematical proofs. This release, version 0.01, falls a long
way short of that ideal: the 'TODO' file will give an indication of what
I believe is still required.

Requirements

the distribution file, Codex-0.01.tar.gz
perl version 5.005_54 or later
(a ReadLine package such as Term::ReadLine::Perl or Term::ReadLine::Gnu
is also recommended)

Installation

Unpack the distribution file. Edit the shebang line of the program 'msh'
if necessary to point to the executable of an appropriate version of perl.

Running

./msh

License

This code is in the public domain: you may do what you like with it,
including selling it. I'd prefer you not to say you wrote it, but you
have the right to do even that.

Description

What the current release can do is to read in definitions files and
proofs (such as the examples supplied), test them for correctness, and
list how it would output what it has parsed. To try it out, unpack the
distribution file, move to the directory it unpacked to, and run the
program 'msh' in that directory.

I won't be adding extensive documentation any time soon, so the point
of first resort should be the perl source for any further information
about capabilities and methods. Similarly, I don't recommend sending
patches against this version: the code is changing to rapidly at this
time for patches to be very relevant. Feel free to send suggestions
about directions to take and ways of getting there.

Enjoy,
